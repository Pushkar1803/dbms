Write a database trigger on Library table. The System should keep track of the records that are being
updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in Library_Audit table.
Scahema:
1) Lib_Audit (bookid number, bookname varchar2(30), issuedate Date, returndate Date,
cardnumber varchar2(10));
2) Library(bookid number, bookname varchar2(30), issuedate Date, returndate Date,cardnumber
varchar2(10));


CREATE TABLE Library (
 book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 title VARCHAR(255),
 author VARCHAR(255)
 );
 
 CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Lib_Aud (
 action VARCHAR(10),
 book_id INT,
 title VARCHAR(255),
 author VARCHAR(255),
 old_value VARCHAR(255),
 timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 );
 
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER before_library_delete
 BEFORE DELETE
 ON Library
 FOR EACH ROW
 BEGIN
 INSERT INTO Lib_Aud (action, book_id, title, author, old_value)
 VALUES ('DELETE', OLD.book_id, OLD.title, OLD.author, 'Record
Deleted');
 END;
