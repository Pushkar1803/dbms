Q4. Create the tables with appropriate constraints and perform the queries. 
Account(Acc_no, branch_name,balance) 
branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets) 
customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city) 
Depositor(cust_name,acc_no) 
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount)
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no) Solve following query:
i.	 Find the average account balance at each branch 
ii.	 Find no. of depositors at each branch.
iii.	 Find the branches where average account balance > 12000. 
iv.	 Find number of tuples in customer relation. 
v.	Calculate total loan amount given by bank. 
vi.	Delete all loans with loan amount between 1300 and 1500. 
vii.	Delete all tuples at every branch located in Nigdi.

Coda :-

create table Account(accno double primary key, branch varchar(20),balance double);

create table branch(branchname varchar(20) primary key, city varchar(20));

create table customer(cname varchar(20) primary key , street varchar(20), custcity varchar(20));

create table depositor(cname VARCHAR(20),accno DOUBLE,FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES customer(cname));

create table loan (loanno DOUBLE PRIMARY KEY,branchname VARCHAR(20),amount DOUBLE ,FOREIGN KEY (branchname) REFERENCES branch(branchname));

create table borrower(cname varchar(30) , loanno double);

insert into Account values(12345, 'akurdi', 30000),(12346, 'sarasbhag',40000),(12347,'khuthrud',12000);

insert into branch values('akurdi','solapur'),('sarasbhag','pune'),('khuthrud','nagar');

insert into customer values('shreyash','xyz','nagar'),('kunal','pqr','solapur'),('dama','abc','pune');


insert into borrower values('shreyash',33),('kunal',28),('dama',62);

select *from Account;

select *from branch;

select *from customer;

select *from depositor;

select *from loan;

select *from borrower;


Find the average account balance at each branch

SELECT branch, AVG(balance) AS avg_balance FROM Account GROUP BY branch;

Find no. of depositors at each branch.


SELECT branch, COUNT(*) AS num_depositors FROM depositor GROUP BY branch;

Find the branches where average account balance > 12000. 


SELECT branch FROM (SELECT branch, AVG(balance) AS avg_balance FROM Account GROUP BY branch ) AS avg_table WHERE avg_balance > 12000;

Find number of tuples in customer relation.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_tuples FROM customer;

Calculate total loan amount given by bank.

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_loan_amount FROM loan;

Delete all loans with loan amount between 1300 and 1500. 

DELETE FROM loan WHERE amount BETWEEN 1300 AND 1500;

Delete all tuples at every branch located in Nigdi.

DELETE FROM Account WHERE branch = 'nigdi';

DELETE FROM branch WHERE branchname = 'nigdi';

DELETE FROM customer WHERE custcity = 'nigdi';

DELETE FROM depositor WHERE cname IN (SELECT cname FROM customer WHERE custcity = 'nigdi');

DELETE FROM loan WHERE branchname = 'nigdi';
