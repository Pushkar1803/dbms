    db.Student_Data.updateMany( { "Class": "TE" }, { $set: { "Class": "BE" } } )


Qiv. Delete the students whose percentage is less than 40.

    db.Student_Data.deleteMany( { "Marks_in_percentage": { $lt: 40 } } ); 

QV. Display department wise first three toppers. 

    db.Student_Data.aggregate([ { $sort: { "Marks_in_percentage": -1 } }, 
{ $group: {  _id: "$dept", toppers: { $push: "$$ROOT" } } }, { $project: { _id: 0, Department: "$_id", TopThree: { $slice: ["$toppers", 3] } } } ]); 

QVi. Display the student’s name those are in First class and participated in sports activity.
